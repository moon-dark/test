Very simple:

>> Put in "/XTRAS" folder files that you want to add recreating 
their full paths. Note that /XTRAS is equivalent to root path in 
the internal memory:


  e.g: 

    /XTRAS/system/etc/gps.conf
    /XTRAS/sdcard/Wallpapers/milfs.jpeg
    /XTRAS/data/app/***.apk
    /XTRAS/whateverfolder/whateverfile



>> Put in "/MORPH" folder your "morph themes". Note that /MORPH is
equivalent to root path in the internal memory and you must rename
folders like the apk but with extension instead the metamorph form
This process will only works in the following folders: /data/app, 
/system/app and /system/framework.


  [[[[[  CAUTION, ARMAGEDDON, KRAKEN IS COMMING, TEETS!!  ]]]]]

     [ DON'T APPLY MORPH TO MARKET APPS, IT'S INCOMPATIBLE ]
                      [ YOU ARE ADVICED ]


  e.g:
 
    /MORPH/system/app/Settings.apk/res/drawable-hdpi/***.png
    /MORPH/system/framework/framework-res.apk/resources.arsc
    /MORPH/data/app/****.apk/res/drawable-hdpi/**.png




>> Take a look to MOD.conf file to enable or disable features a/or 
set special commands if you need it.



>> Flash and enjoy!!
